```js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000',
      changeOrigin: true

## ❗ Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect to MySQL**: Make sure MySQL service is running (via XAMPP).
- **403 Forbidden on files**: Run `php artisan storage:link` and ensure `storage/app/public` has correct permissions.
- **Proxy error in React**: Laravel backend must be running on `localhost:8000`.
